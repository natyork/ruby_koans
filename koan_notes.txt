  -learned about assertion syntax for testing

Nil Class
  -nil is an object in ruby

Ruby Exceptions (begin rescue end)
  one_thing => another_thing assigns key value pairs in a hash (hash rocket)

    # THINK ABOUT IT:
    #
    # Is it better to use
    #    obj.nil?
    # or
    #    obj == nil
    # Why?
only the object nil with return true to either of these statements
